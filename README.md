# Tic Tac Toe

This is the README for the project TicTacToe that I worked on.

# Planning Story

When it came to planning out my very first project I didn't know where to begin or even where to start and then I talked to some people who helped me calm down. I started my planning by doing my user stories because they would help me figure out what needs to be done for the project. I took everything day by day and making up a checklist of what needs to be done for each day. I liked breaking up my project like that it kept me more focused on what needed to be done that day and checking off completed tasks kept me going.
